# RandomPasswordGenerator


I created a random password generator to help users create a secure password using different types of characters.

## Javascript

I used javascript functions and conditionals to create prompts to ask the user what type of characters they would like included in the password. I also confirmed how many characters the user wants. I used a join method to combine all the user selections or characters and length to create a new password string.
